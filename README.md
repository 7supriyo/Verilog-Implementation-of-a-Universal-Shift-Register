This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 4-bit Universal Shift Register. The Universal Shift Register is a versatile digital circuit that supports multiple operating modes, making it an essential component in various digital systems.

## Features

- **Hold**: Retains the current state of the register.
- **Shift Left**: Shifts the bits in the register to the left.
- **Shift Right**: Shifts the bits in the register to the right.
- **Parallel Load**: Loads a 4-bit parallel input into the register.
- **Recirculate**: Recirculates the data within the register.


## Usage

The Universal Shift Register can be used in various digital system applications, including:

- Data storage and transfer
- Serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial conversion
- Arithmetic operations and more
