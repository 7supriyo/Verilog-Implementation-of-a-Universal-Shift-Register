# Verilog-Implementation-of-a-Universal-Shift-Register
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 4-bit universal shift register. It demonstrates various operating modes including hold, shift left, shift right, parallel load, and recirculate.

## Project Overview

Verilog-Implementation-of-a-Universal-Shift-Register is designed to demonstrate the fundamental principles of shift registers and their various operating modes. The project emphasizes clarity, modularity, and testability, making it easy to understand, modify, and integrate into larger designs.

### Key Features

* **4-Bit Universal Shift Register:** A flexible register capable of multiple operating modes.
* **Verilog HDL Implementation:** Written in standard Verilog for broad compatibility.
* **Modular Design:** Separates functionality into distinct modules (D flip-flop, multiplexer, and shift register) for clarity and reusability.
* **Comprehensive Testbench:** Includes a detailed testbench to verify all operating modes.
* **Waveform Visualization:** Generates a VCD file for easy waveform analysis with GTKWave.
* **Detailed Documentation:** This README provides a thorough explanation of the design and usage.
* **Clear and Commented Code:** Verilog code is well-commented for easy understanding.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **`D_FlipFlop.v`:** Verilog module implementing a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop with asynchronous reset.
* **`Mux_8_to_1.v`:** Verilog module implementing an 8-to-1 multiplexer.
* **`Universal_Shift_Register.v`:** Verilog module implementing the 4-bit universal shift register.
* **`Universal_Shift_Register_tb.v`:** Verilog testbench for the universal shift register.
* **`README.md`:** This project documentation.
